# MergeRatePBH

Code in phyton to plot and obtain the primordial black hole merge rate considering different models.

These codes are based on the work developed in Abram PÃ©rez Herrero's final thesis. We have also used the data obtained from the article https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14533 , https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02786 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00868 . The data of the article 2010.14533 is freely available on https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0171/P2000434/002/Fig-3-m1-ppd.tar.gz. and it is necessary to obtain this data in order for the codes to work correctly. Once downloaded, it is recommended to download the data with name 'o1o2o3_mass_c_iid_mag_two_comp_iid_tilt_powerlaw_redshift_mass_data' and insert in a new folder namely DataLVO3. 

Once this action is done, the following codes generate a txt with the data of the constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes: 

 ConstraintsCC.py  # To obtain the constraints for a Critical Collapse mass function\
 ConstraintsLN.py  # To obtain the constraints for a Log-Normal mass function\
 ConstraintsPL.py  # To obtain the constraints for a Power-Law mass function\
 ConstraintsMonochromatic.py # To obtain the constraints for a monochromatic mass function\
 Monochromaticlowmass.py  # To obtain the constraints for a monochromatic mass function and lower masses\
 
Also, all the mass function described in the work are defined in MassFunction.py

The Figures are obtained with the following codes:
